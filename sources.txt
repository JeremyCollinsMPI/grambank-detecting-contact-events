aust1305    7000    A subsequent computational phylogenetic analysis (Sidwell 2015b)[15] suggests that Austroasiatic branches may have a loosely nested structure rather than a completely rake-like structure, with an east–west division (consisting of Munda, Khasic, Palaungic, and Khmuic forming a western group as opposed to all of the other branches) occurring possibly as early as 7,000 years before present.      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austroasiatic_languages#cite_note-Sidwell2015-18
